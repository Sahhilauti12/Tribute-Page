        Shivaji Bhonsale , also referred to as Chhatrapati Shivaji, was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle
        Maratha clan. Shivaji carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur that formed the
        genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.[6]

        Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the
        Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded
        the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a
        competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu
        political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing
        Persian in court and administration.
        hivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he began to take on
        increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists
        elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.

      <h3 id="gold">All About his Golden Journey </h3>
      Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune district. Scholars
      disagree on his date of birth. The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating
      Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti).[a][16][17] Shivaji was named after a local deity, the goddess Shivai.[18][19]
      Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates.[20] His mother was
      Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav
      royal family of Devagiri.

      Shivaji belonged to Maratha family of Bhonsle clan.[23] His paternal grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an
      influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of "Raja". He was given deshmukhi rights
      of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. He was also given Fort Shivneri for his family's
      residence

      At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur, Ahmednagar,
      and Golkonda. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshah of Bijapur and
      the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army.[20]

      Background and context
      A political map of peninsular India c. 1605. The Mughal Empire lies above the peninsula; the peninsula consists of
      Ahmadnagar in the northwest, Bijapur in the west, Golconda in the east and northeast and the poligar kingdoms in
      the south and southeast.
      South India at the turn of the 17th century
      In 1636, the Adil Shahi sultanate of Bijapur invaded the kingdoms to its south.[26] The sultanate had recently
      become a tributary state of the Mughal empire.[26][27] It was being helped by Shahaji, who at the time was a
      chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India. Shahaji was looking for opportunities of rewards of jagir land
      in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an annuity.[26]

      Shahji was a rebel from brief Mughal service. Shahji's campaigns against the Mughals, supported by the Bijapur
      government, were generally unsuccessful. He was constantly pursued by the Mughal army and Shivaji and his mother
      Jijabai had to move from fort to fort.[28]

      In 1636, Shahaji joined in the service of Bijapur and obtained Poona as a grant. Shivaji and Jijabai settled in
      Poona. Shahaji, being deployed in Bangalore by the Bijapuri ruler Adilshah, appointed Dadoji Kondadeo as
      administrator. Kondadeo died in 1647 and Shivaji took over the administration. One of his first acts directly
      challenged the Bijapuri government.[29]

      Conflict with Bijapur
      In 1646, the 16-year-old Shivaji took the Torna Fort taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the Bijapur
      and seized the large treasure he found there.[30][31] In the following two years, Shivaji took several important
      forts near Pune, including Purandhar, Kondhana and Chakan. Also, He brought Supa, Baramati and Indapur under his
      direct control. He used the money found at Torna to build a new fort Raigad, which served as his capital for over
      a decade.[30] After this, Shivaji turned to the Konkan and took possession of the important town of Kalyan.
      Bijapur government took note of these happenings and sought to take action. On 25 July 1648, Shahaji was
      imprisoned by Baji Ghorpade under the orders of Bijapuri ruler Mohammed Adilshah, in a bid to contain Shivaji.[32]

      Shahaji was released in 1649 after the capture of Jinji secured Adilshah's position in Karnataka. During 1649–1655
      Shivaji paused in his conquests and quietly consolidated his gains.[33] After his release, Shahaji retired from
      public life, and died around 1664–1665 in a hunting accident. Following his father's release, Shivaji resumed
      raiding, and in 1656, under controversial circumstances, killed Chandrarao More, a fellow Maratha feudatory of
      Bijapur, and seized the valley of Javali, near present-day Mahabaleshwar, from him.[34] In addition to the
      Bhonsale and the More families, many others including Sawant of Sawantwadi, Ghorpade of Mudhol, Nimbalkar of
      Phaltan, Shirke, Mane and Mohite also served Adilshahi of Bijapur, many with Deshmukhi rights. Shivaji adopted
      different strategies to subdue these powerful families such as marrying their daughters, dealing directly with
      village Patil to bypass the Deshmukhs, or fighting them.
      Combat with Afzal Khan

      An early-20th-century painting by Sawlaram Haldankar of Shivaji fighting the Bijapuri general Afzal Khan
      Adilshah was displeased at his losses to Shivaji's forces, which his vassal Shahaji disavowed. Having ended his
      conflict with the Mughals and having a greater ability to respond, in 1657 Adilshah sent Afzal Khan, a veteran
      general, to arrest Shivaji. Before engaging him, the Bijapuri forces desecrated the Tulja Bhavani Temple, holy to
      Shivaji's family, and the Vithoba temple at Pandharpur, a major pilgrimage site for the Hindus.[36][37][38]

      Pursued by Bijapuri forces, Shivaji retreated to Pratapgad fort, where many of his colleagues pressed him to
      surrender.[39] The two forces found themselves at a stalemate, with Shivaji unable to break the siege, while Afzal
      Khan, having a powerful cavalry but lacking siege equipment, was unable to take the fort. After two months, Afzal
      Khan sent an envoy to Shivaji suggesting the two leaders meet in private outside the fort to parley.[40][41]

      The two met in a hut at the foothills of Pratapgad fort on 10 November 1659. The arrangements had dictated that
      each come armed only with a sword, and attended by one follower. Shivaji, suspecting Afzal Khan would arrest or
      attack him,[42][b] wore armour beneath his clothes, concealed a bagh nakh (metal "tiger claw") on his left arm,
      and had a dagger in his right hand.[44] The precise transpirings are not recoverable to historical certainty and
      remains enmeshed with legends in Maratha sources; however, they agree upon the fact that the protagonists landed
      themselves in a physical struggle which would prove fatal for Khan.[c] Khan's dagger failed to pierce Shivaji's
      armour, but Shivaji had him disemboweled; he then fired a cannon to signal his hidden troops to attack the
      Bijapuri army.[46]

      In the ensuing Battle of Pratapgarh fought on 10 November 1659, Shivaji's forces decisively defeated the Bijapur
      Sultanate's forces. More than 3,000 soldiers of the Bijapur army were killed and one sardar of high rank, two sons
      of Afzal Khan and two Maratha chiefs were taken prisoner.[47] After the victory, a grand review was held by
      Shivaji below Pratapgarh. The captured enemy, both officers and men, were set free and sent back to their homes
      with money, food and other gifts. Marathas were rewarded accordingly.[47]


      Pratapgad fort
      Siege of Panhala
      Having defeated the Bijapuri forces sent against him, Shivaji's army marched towards the Konkan and Kolhapur,
      seizing Panhala fort, and defeating Bijapuri forces sent against them under Rustam Zaman and Fazl Khan in
      1659.[48] In 1660, Adilshah sent his general Siddi Jauhar to attack Shivaji's southern border, in alliance with
      the Mughals who planned to attack from the north. At that time, Shivaji was encamped at Panhala fort with his
      forces. Siddi Jauhar's army besieged Panhala in mid-1660, cutting off supply routes to the fort. During the
      bombardment of Panhala, Siddi Jauhar purchased grenades from the English at Rajapur to increase his efficacy, and
      also hired some English artillerymen to assist in his bombardment of the fort, conspicuously flying a flag used by
      the English. This perceived betrayal angered Shivaji, who in December would retaliate by plundering the English
      factory at Rajapur and capturing four of the factors, imprisoning them until mid-1663.[49]

      After months of siege, Shivaji negotiated with Siddi Jauhar and handed over the fort on 22 September 1660,
      withdrawing to Vishalgad;[50] Shivaji retook Panhala in 1673.
